    title: 'Professional Certification Course, 10 weeks',
    text: 'To pursue my goal of lifelong learning, I jumped into this exciting program to increase my knowledge of UX and gain a deeper understanding of the design process and current industry best practices. Our expert instructors brought us through a curiculum highlighting the design process from research and strategy to planning to mockups to design creation. We focused on learning to think like a designer, apply usability heuristics and continually iterate. We used tools such as Figma to create high fidelity designs. I now have a deep understanding of this process and this will help me collaborate with designers and UX specific colleagues as well as enrich my own perspective towards clients\' needs.',

    title: 'Advanced Full Stack Javascript Bootcamp, 18 weeks',
    text: 'I completed over 900 hours of solo and paired programming, using the latest web development technologies and practices. Before starting the program, Intermediate JavaScript knowledge and a demonstration of sufficient autonomy and competency to keep up with the intense pace were required. This was determined by a selective interview process and 80 hours of mandatory pre-course work. In addition, I completed over 100 hours of self-study to prepare for the interview. The introductory section (40 hrs/week, weeks 1-6) consisted of two-day, paired sprints strengthening Computer Science fundamentals and skills, such as debugging, functional programming, automated testing and recursion. The junior phase (60 hrs/week, weeks 7-11) involved project based learning, navigating large code bases using new technologies each sprint. In the senior phase (60 hrs/week, weeks 12-18), I worked with two distributed agile teams completing daily standups, merge requests, code reviews and project documentation. Throughout, I completed daily toy problems and created additional full-stack applications to broaden my knowledge and practice my skills.',

    text: 'After completing my Linguistics degree at the University of Toronto, I started a second degree towards becoming a recreational therapist or speech pathologist. I learned, however, that I missed the highly technical nature of the upper year Linguistics courses from my first degree. This served as the catalyst for my software engineering career.',

    title: 'Major in Linguistics, Minors in Anthropology and French',
    text: 'Here I discovered my love of Linguistics and Anthropology. An inspiring high school teacher had mentioned Linguistics and explained some verb tenses in Zulu from his native South Africa, which fascinated me. When I saw Linguistics on the list of programs, I enrolled in the first year course and learned how linguists uncover the mechanisms behind something people use unconsciously! That intrigued me. I discovered the same pattern in my Anthropology classes and later through my journey into software engineering. All three branches of knowledge consist of simple symbols joined together in complex patterns to communicate information.',
