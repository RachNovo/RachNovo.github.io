    title: 'Advanced Full Stack Javascript Bootcamp, 18 weeks',
    text: 'I completed 900+ hours of solo and paired programming, using the latest web development technologies and practices. Before starting the program, Intermediate JavaScript knowledge and a demonstration of sufficient autonomy and competency to keep up with the intense pace were required. This was determined by a selective interview process and 80 hours of mandatory pre-course work. In addition, I completed over 100 hours of self-study to prepare for the interview. The introductory section (40 hours of classtime per week) consisted of two-day, paired sprints strengthening CS fundamentals and skills such as debugging, functional programming, automated testing and recursion. The junior phase (60 hours of classtime per week) involved project based learning, navigating large code bases using new technologies each sprint. In the senior phase, I worked with two distributed agile teams completing daily standups, merge requests, code reviews and project documentation. Throughout, I completed daily toy problems and created various full-stack mini-app projects to strengthen my knowledge and practice my skills.',

    title: 'First Year, Therapeutic Recreation',
    text: 'After completing my Linguistics degree at the University of Toronto, I started a second degree towards becoming a recreational therapist or a speech pathologist. I learned, however, that I missed the highly technical nature of the upper year Linguistics courses and that this program did not suit me. After finishing the year, I began considering my options for self-starting in the field of software engineering.',

    title: 'Major in Linguistics, Minors in Anthropology and French',
    text: 'Here I discovered my love of Sociocultural Linguistics. An inspiring high school teacher had mentioned Linguistics and explained some verb tenses in Zulu from his native South Africa, which fascinated me. When I saw Linguistics on the list of programs, I enrolled in the first year course. I learned how linguists uncover the mechanisms behind something people use unconsciously! That intrigued me. I discovered the same pattern in my Anthropology classes and later through my journey into software engineering. All three branches of knowledge consist of simple symbols joined together in complex patterns to communicate information.',
