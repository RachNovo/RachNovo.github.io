    title: 'Advanced Full Stack Javascript Bootcamp, 18 weeks',
    text: '900+ hours of solo and paired programming using the latest web development technologies and practices. Intermediate JavaScript knowledge and a demonstration of sufficient autonomy and competency to keep up with the intense pace were required prior to the start date, determined by a selective interview process and 80 hours of mandatory pre-course work. I completed over 100 hours of self-study in preparation for the interview. The introductory section consisted of two-day, paired sprints strengthening CS fundamentals and skills such as debugging, functional programming, automated testing, and recursion. The junior phase continued the sprints completing projects navigating large code bases using unfamiliar technologies. In the senior phase, I worked with two distributed agile teams completing daily standups, merge requests, code reviews and project documentation. Throughout, I completed daily toy problems and created various full-stack mini-app projects to strengthen my knowledge.',
